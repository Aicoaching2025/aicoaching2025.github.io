# Linear Algebra with Images

This project visualizes image transformations using matrix operations and NumPy.

## Key Features
- Image loading and transformation (e.g., rotation, scaling)
- Matrix multiplication and inverse operations
- Visualization with `matplotlib`

## Skills Demonstrated
Matrix algebra, NumPy operations, linear transformations
